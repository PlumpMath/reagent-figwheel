# reagent-figwheel (leiningen template)

Leiningen template for [reagent](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent) web apps.

Through the use of profiles, this template lets the developer pick and choose what is included in their application.

## Usage

The base template includes:

* [reagent](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent)
* [figwheel](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel)

To create an application with the base template:

```
lein new reagent-figwheel <project-name>
```

The optional profiles include:

* [cider](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider) (`+cider`)
* [cljs.test](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/blob/master/src/main/cljs/cljs/test.cljs) and [doo](https://github.com/bensu/doo) (`+test`)
* [devcards](https://github.com/bhauman/devcards) (`+devcards`)
* [garden](https://github.com/noprompt/garden) (`+garden`)
* [keechma (framework)](https://github.com/keechma/keechma) (`+keechma`)
* [less](https://github.com/montoux/lein-less) (`+less`)
* [petrol (framework)](https://github.com/krisajenkins/petrol) (`+petrol`)
* [secretary](https://github.com/gf3/secretary) (`+routes`)

To add a profile to the base template, just append the profile name (let's use `+routes` as an example):

```
lein new reagent-figwheel <project-name> +routes
```

Most combinations of profiles can be added at once:

```
lein new reagent-figwheel <project-name> +cider +test +garden +less +routes
```

The only restrictios are:

* Only pick up to one *"framework"*, `+keechma` or `+petrol`
* If `+keechma` and `+routes` are used together, only `+keechma` will be applied.*

## Development Mode

### Start Cider from Emacs (if using +cider):

Put this in your Emacs config file:

```
(setq cider-cljs-lein-repl "(do (use 'figwheel-sidecar.repl-api) (start-figwheel!) (cljs-repl))")
```

Navigate to a clojurescript file and start a figwheel REPL with `cider-jack-in-clojurescript` or (`C-c M-J`)


### Compile css (if using +garden or +less):

Compile css file once.

```
lein garden once
```

or

```
lein less once
```

Automatically recompile css file on change.

```
lein garden auto
```

or

```
lein less auto
```

### Run application:

```
lein clean
lein figwheel dev
```

Figwheel will automatically push cljs changes to the browser.

Wait a bit, then browse to [http://localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449).

### Run tests (if using +test):

```
lein clean
lein doo phantom test once
```

The above command assumes that you have [phantomjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/phantomjs) installed. However, please note that [doo](https://github.com/bensu/doo) can be configured to run cljs.test in many other JS environments (chrome, ie, safari, opera, slimer, node, rhino, or nashorn).

### Devcards (if using +devcards)

```
lein clean
lein figwheel devcards
```

Figwheel will automatically push cljs changes to the browser.

Wait a bit, then browse to [http://localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449).
